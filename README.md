## Using Toxiclibs jars in JRubyArt
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/toxiclibs.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/toxiclibs)
### Installing
```bash
gem install toxiclibs --pre
```

### Also works with ruby-processing

Here we demonstrate how to create a gem to use Karsten Schmidts (aka toxi, @postspectacular) toxiclibs jars in JRubyArt. To compile the gem follow the instructions for [JRubyArt][]. Most part of toxiclibs API is exposed in the latest version, (but only a few examples are included) in principle it should be possible to make all available!!! For this demonstration I have used up to date source code for version 21, since [toxis final release][] may never materialise (he's probably got more interesting things to do). There are reported to be number of outstanding bugs with toxiclibs, if they affect you report it [here][] (or better fix them yourself and submit a pull request).
